 Hi everyone my name is Joanne Rayment and I am a newly certified
        Counsellor/Coach here in Abu Dhabi. I was a Nurse for 30 years in the UK
        and my specialty was End-of-life Care for Children and Adults. A big
        part of a nurses role is to be able to actively listen to the patients.
        With this in mind I decided to extend my nursing skills to coaching and
        guiding people through the rolla coaster, that is life. Like so many I
        have experienced many traumatic events in my life which enables me to
        have a genuine empathy with my clients. My goal is to be a safe haven
        for women in need, I want women to know they are not alone. I'm
        approachable and do not judge. My skills developed over the years have
        helped me show my clients the light at the end of the tunnel. If I can
        do it then so can you! My specialties are General Counselling, Grief &
        Bereavement, Sexual Abuse and Depression. I am offering a FREE 20 minute
        zoom video call. This is your chance to see and get to know me. I will
        tell you how my sessions work and start you on the road to self
        discovery and self belief. Then YOU can decide if I am the right person
        to help you. Here is the link to book your free session:
        https://calendlyom/joanne-141/20 If you need a time slot which is not on
        my calendar just contact me and I will try to accommodate you. I look
        forward to hearing from you. Take care Joanne
