      <h2 id="general-counselling">General Counselling</h2>
      <p>
        The counselling process is a planned, structured dialogue between a
        counsellor and a client. It is a cooperative process in which a trained
        professional helps a person called the client to identify sources of
        difficulties or concerns that he or she is experiencing.
      </p>
      <h2 id="sexual-abuse">Sexual Abuse</h2>
      <p>
        Counsellors who help survivors are trained to help with the
        psychological effects of sexual violence. This may include low
        confidence levels, anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder
        (PTSD). You can speak to a counsellor at any time - even if you
        experienced sexual abuse many years ago.

      <h2 id="grief-and-bereavement">Grief and Bereavement</h2>
      <p>
        Your bereavement counsellor will help you better understand the grieving
        process, process your grief, and assist you in working through the
        stages of grief. Your therapist will support you to work through
        difficult feelings around your loss. How does bereavement counselling
        work? Typically a counsellor or psychologist will encourage the grieving
        person to share their thoughts and feelings about the loss, and
        encourage them to engage with life in a way which helps them to recover
        from their grief.
      </p>
      <h2 id="children-and-adolescents">Children and Adolescents</h2>
      <p>
        Child counseling is a type of therapy that focuses on young children,
        teens, and adolescents with one or more mental illnesses. It also
        provides aid to youths, who have experienced trauma, and/or who are
        experiencing a dysfunctional or stressful home environment
      </p>
      <h2 id="depression">Depression</h2>
      <p>
        Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical
        illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how
        you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings
        of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. It
        can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can
        decrease your ability to function at work and at home. If there is no
        underlying medical cause for your symptoms of depression, talk therapy
        (counselling/coaching) can be an extremely effective treatment. What you
        learn in therapy gives you skills and insight to feel better and help
        prevent depression from coming back
